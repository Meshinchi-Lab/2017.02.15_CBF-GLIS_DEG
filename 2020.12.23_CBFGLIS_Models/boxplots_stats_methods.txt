# 19 AUTHOR: Please specify the values for the box-and-whisker plots in B [the bounds of the boxes, the lines within the boxes, the whiskers, and any outlying values]. If this description applies to all box-and-whisker plots throughout, then this can be added to the Statistics section.)

Box and whisker plots denote the median (middle line) with 25th (lower bound of box) and 75th percentiles (upper bound of box) as hinges; upper and lower whiskers extend from the hinge to 1.5*IQR (interquartile range). All individual samples' expression are plotted and outliers are those with expression values beyond the whisker.

Difference in expression between C/G-CB in E/C or M/C conditions compared to GFP controls in E/C or M/C conditions, respectively, was determined using an unpaired two.sided non-parametric wilcoxon rank sum test. Primary C/G AML samples were compared to healthy normal bone marrows using same method as described.

# 20. AUTHOR: Please confirm added asterisk definitions and specify the statistical test. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.005, ***P < 0.0005

The significance values are denoted in figure 3B:
    ns: p > 0.05
    *: p <= 0.05
    **: p <= 0.01
    ***: p <= 0.001
    ****: p <= 0.0001

# 22. AUTHOR: See Query 19 regarding panels B and C.)

OK to use the same definition above for boxplots.
